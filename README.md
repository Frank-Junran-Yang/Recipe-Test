## Overview and Introduction  
**DSC80 Final Project | UCSD**  

As a data science student and fitness enthusiast, I've always believed nutrition is the foundation of physical transformation. "You can't out-train a bad diet" – this project explores how data science can help us make better nutritional choices by analyzing over 80,000 recipes from Food.com.
Key Questions Explored:
How does protein content relate to recipe ratings?
Can we accurately predict calories from nutritional features?
Are there biases in how recipes are rated or described?
This work combines exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling to uncover insights for health-conscious cooks and data scientists alike.

We analyze two interconnected datasets from Food.com:

1. Recipes Dataset (83,782 recipes × 12 columns)

Key Insight: The nutrition data uses Percentage Daily Values (PDV). I will add a column called protein_gram that converts protein to grams for interpretability

2. Interactions Dataset (731,927 reviews × 5 columns)

| Column        | Description         |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| `'user_id'`   | User ID             |
| `'recipe_id'` | Recipe ID           |
| `'date'`      | Date of interaction |
| `'rating'`    | Rating given        |
| `'review'`    | Review text         |

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
To prepare the recipe data for analysis, I performed several critical cleaning steps. First, I replaced zero values in the ratings column with NaN (using merged['rating'].replace(0, np.nan)), as these likely represent missing data rather than true zero-star ratings on Food.com's 1-5 scale. Next, I calculated average ratings per recipe by grouping by recipe ID and merging the results back into the dataset (groupby('id')['rating'].mean()), creating a consistent target variable for analysis. The nutrition data—originally stored as a string resembling a list (e.g., "[calories, fat, sugar,...]")—was split into separate columns (str.strip('[]').str.split(',').apply(pd.Series)) to enable individual analysis of each nutritional component. I then added a new column called `protein_grams` by stripping whitespace and converting values in `protein` to floats, and finally converted protein from Percentage Daily Value (PDV) to grams (protein * DAILY_PROTEIN_GRAMS / 100), making the values more interpretable for fitness applications. These steps collectively transformed raw data into an analysis-ready format by handling missing values, decomposing packed fields, standardizing units, and ensuring numeric consistency—all while preserving the dataset's integrity for downstream modeling and visualization.
